    "    Load the CSV you just saved from data/processed/ so you're working with the fully featured DataFrame.                                                                                                               \n",

    "\n",
    "    Check the split of your target — how many up days vs down days? If it's roughly 50/50, that's good. If it's heavily skewed (like 70/30), you'll need to account for that when modeling.                             \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature vs target comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each feature, ask: does this feature look different on up days vs down days?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Group by Target, then look at the mean of each feature. E.g., average RSI on up days vs down days. If they're noticeably different, that feature might have signal.\n",
    "    - Histograms/box plots — for key features (RSI, MACD, Volume Ratio, Daily Return, Price Relative to MA), plot the distribution split by Target=0 vs Target=1. If the distributions overlap almost completely, the feature is weak. If they separate, it has potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Correlation heatmap\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Compute the correlation between all your features and the Target. This gives you a quick ranking of which features have the strongest linear relationship with direction. Also check correlation between features themselves — highly correlated features (like MA_20 and Price_Relative_to_MA_20) are redundant, and you may want to drop one.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write down observations\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note which features look promising and which look like noise. This will guide which features you keep when you train your first model.ß"
